# About

Two of my biggest childhood passions were building LEGOS and earning money (by selling "Ikezy Sticks" aka straws filled with sugar and operating my own paper route) - two foundational traits of entrepreneurs everywhere. These early interests were a basis to construct my current creative, development, and entrepreneurial skill sets. With a background in Anti-Money Laundering Investigations, Operations Analysis, and Photography, I am a hybrid of the analytical/process orientated and creative worlds. Currently, as a Front-end Developer with experience in full-stack JavaScript (MERN), I am passionate about crafting digital experiences using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and other tools.

I am laser-focused on creating digital things with compelling design. Building startup projects from the ground up like RainierWatch.com (a mountain loving community of 30,000+ people), MadeWithSpark.com (which had 1,400 visitors in its first 5 days) and BlackBerryCentral.com (Top 3 BlackBerry fan site by web traffic) is a passion of mine.

As a design/UX enthusiast, I am constantly testing out the latest tool and user experiences. I fall head over heels for companies with intuitive beautiful designs that are unapologetically focused on the customer and are dedicated to digital. Giving back to humanity is important to me, especially through technology.

In my spare time, I'm an eclectic dabbler in various realms. I'm an avid yet mediocre outdoorsman, side project starter, adventurer, footballer (of the European variety), photographer, and personal finance nut with a data-driven mindset dating back to my time as a student of Economics. Never afraid to send the latest meme, I also consider myself a careful crafter of electronic communication.
