# Uses

Here's what I'm using these days: 


## Editor + Terminal + Coding

- VS Code
- Synthwave theme
- Hyper or iTerm depending on the day
- macOS
- My daily browser is Firefox because its super rad and for debugging I use Firefox Developer Edition or Chrome
- Font of choice for coding: Dank Mono
- CMS of choice: Statamic
- CSS of choice: TailwindCSS
- Vue.js or Nuxt.js or Gridsome (aka Vue across the board)

## Desktop Setup

- MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) - 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 - 16GB DDR3 RAM - 500GB SSD HD
- My desk is the Uplift with white legs
- My mech keyboard that I love is a [Keychron 2](http://dlndl.co/keychron)
- My laptop is perfectly positioned via the iLevel Rain Design Stand

## Desktop Apps

- I use [the hand mirror app](https://handmirror.app/) to make sure I'm not totally hideous when I show up at video meetings
- Sipp.app is an amazing little app for grabbing and storing color palettes
- [CopyClip](https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclip-for-mac) is a life saver because it stores the gazillion copies that I do. It will change your workflow.
- Magnet is how I manage all my windows

## Apps I couldnt live without

- [1Password](http://dlndl.co/1pw) is the greatest thing since melted butter.
- ProtonVPN keeps my internet traffic secure, which is super important when on public wifi.
- I organize nearly everything on kanbans via [Trello](http://dlndl.co/trello) but am worried their Atlassian overlords will kill it
- For dev projects [Basecamp Personal](https://basecamp.com/personal) is the coolest thing ever

## Servers and stuff

- I try to avoid server management as much as I can because it makes my blood boil.
- For WordPress I've loved [Flywheel](http://rnwt.ch/flywheel)
- For cheap shared hosting and domains with free privacy I've used [DreamHost](http://dlndl.co/dh) for years without complaint
- [Cloudinary](http://dlndl.co/cloudinary) makes responsive image hosting super easy because #perfmatters


## Photography

- Currently I do a lot of mobile photography with my [Moment gear](http://dlndl.co/moment)
- My DSLR for paid gigs and weddings is a Nikon D750
- DLSR Lenses include: 
 - 80-200 f/2.8
 - 16-35mm f/4
 - 50mm f/1.4
 - 85mm f/1.8

## Financials

Yes I'm a huge financial/budget nerd. Lots more coming here soon.
