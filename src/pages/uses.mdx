# Uses

Here's what I'm using these days: 


## Editor + Terminal + Coding

- VS Code
- the amazing [SynthWave '84 theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode)
- Hyper (maxed out to the synthwave colors) or iTerm depending on the day
- macOS
- My daily browser is Firefox because its super rad and for debugging I use Firefox Developer Edition or Chrome or Brave
- Font of choice for coding: [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/)
- CMS of choice: [Statamic](https://statamic.com/)
- CSS of choice: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/#what-is-tailwind)
- Vue.js or Nuxt.js or Gridsome (aka Vue across the board)

## That freelance life
- Time tracking and invoices via [harvest](http://dlndl.co/harvest)
- Basecamp Personal is often what I use for organizing projects because I can't afford the full version. Or Trello.

## Desktop Setup

- MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) - 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 - 16GB DDR3 RAM - 500GB SSD HD
- My desk is the [Uplift V2](https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-standing-desk-v2-or-v2-commercial/) with white legs
- My mech keyboard that I love is a [Keychron 2](http://dlndl.co/keychron)
- My laptop is perfectly positioned via the iLevel Rain Design Stand

## Desktop Apps

- Nearly everything I design (including apparel because I'm crazy and boycotting Adobe) is in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- I use [the hand mirror app](https://handmirror.app/) to make sure I'm not totally hideous when I show up at video meetings
- Sipp.app is an amazing little app for grabbing and storing color palettes
- [CopyClip](https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclip-for-mac) is a life saver because it stores the gazillion copies that I do. It will change your workflow.
- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) is how I manage all my windows across my laptop and monitor

## Apps I couldnt live without

- [Newton Mail](https://newtonhq.com/) is the best mail app I've found with [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) a close second. Yes Newton costs money, but yes it's worth it. I value the ability to manage my 10ish email accounts with a sign login, clean UI, and apps for everything including Android
- [1Password](http://dlndl.co/1pw) is the greatest thing since melted butter. I have everything in it. That link will give you 6 months. There's not a single thing I recommend more to anyone. It will change your life. Imagine having to remember only a _single password_ ?! Game changer. 
- ProtonVPN keeps my internet traffic secure, which is super important when on public wifi.
- I organize nearly everything on kanbans via [Trello](http://dlndl.co/trello) but am worried their Atlassian overlords will kill it
- For dev projects [Basecamp Personal](https://basecamp.com/personal) is the coolest thing ever
- I would use [Dropbox](http://dlndl.co/dropbox) for file sharing but because I've got some hookups I'm using OneDrive because its dirt cheap for me. I have almost all my files on the cloud and use it daily. 

## Servers and stuff

- I try to avoid server management as much as I can because it makes my blood boil.
- For WordPress I've loved [Flywheel](http://rnwt.ch/flywheel)
- For cheap shared hosting and domains with free privacy I've used [DreamHost](http://dlndl.co/dh) for years without complaint
- [Cloudinary](http://dlndl.co/cloudinary) makes responsive image hosting super easy because #perfmatters


## Photography

- Currently I do a lot of [mobile photography](https://instagram.com/austriker) with my [Moment gear](http://dlndl.co/moment)
- My DSLR for paid gigs and weddings is a Nikon D750
- DLSR Lenses include: 
 - 80-200 f/2.8
 - 16-35mm f/4
 - 50mm f/1.4
 - 85mm f/1.8

## Financials

Yes, I'm a huge financial/budget nerd. Lots more coming here soon.
