As a newb starting out in web design thanks for posting these thoughts and advice and looking to pivot careers in the near future. Very helpful as I’m looking to build my future and personal site.

I think the ratings yourself idea sounds pretty fun and a good way to show off your skills in a visual manner. I Like how a certain learning site shows off your ‘levels based on what you’ve learned with them’. That originally got me thinking I should add “my levels” to my page but you have enlightened me. I Like the approach of “what you are learning, versus what you are confident in” much better. Thanks!
