Its a tricky scenario, drilling down your apps to essentials. There’s so many of those apps for those one-off situations that only come up once inawhile. For me, apps like AirBnB are like that; I only use it when traveling; which isnt that often. So I uninstalled.

Here’s my most used apps per my launcher:

1.  BBM
2.  Chrome (beta)
3.  Slack
4.  Twitter (/Twitter Client of the week)
5.  Instagram
6.  Calendar
7.  Google Keep

I would also throw essentials in there… like Spotify, VSCO, SquareCash, Garmin Connect, BlackBerry HUB, and DarkSky.
